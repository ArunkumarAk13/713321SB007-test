        <p style="text-indent: 100px;">E-Commerce Defined: E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the online exchange of goods, services, funds, and data over the internet. It’s a digital marketplace where businesses and consumers interact, buy, and sell without the need for physical storefronts. E-commerce relies on technology and various digital platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and social media, to facilitate transactions.

            Here are some key points about e-commerce:
            <br><br><br>
            Global Reach: Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar stores limited by geographical boundaries, e-commerce allows businesses to reach customers worldwide. Whether you’re in New York or New Delhi, customers can place orders, and you can ship products or provide services seamlessly.
            Lower Operating Costs: Setting up and maintaining an e-commerce website is generally more cost-effective than running a physical store. You avoid expenses like rent, warehouse space, and property maintenance. Additionally, online advertising (through blog posts, social media, etc.) tends to be more budget-friendly.</p>
